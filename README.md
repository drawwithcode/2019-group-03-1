## About the Project

###### WHAT IS "KING OF MI AMI"
The King of Mi Ami is inspired by the legend of “The Sword in the Stone”.
Whoever extracts the sword becomes king for a day. This project is designed to be an easy way to escape from the boredom of a long wait and to engage a large number of people in a group game. The King of Mi Ami is meant to be played in the context of a festival, that in this case is the Mi Ami Festival of Milan, where there is need to entertain a large group of fans before the show begins. Everyone who possesses a smartphone and is located inside a defined area can access the game and can conquer to become the daily king by dragging the legendary sword out of the stone. The sword can be touched only every 10 seconds and in the meanwhile the user can see other gamers’ attempts. If the sword isn’t touched in 15 seconds, it will go back inside the rock. If a user manages to pull out the sword, he/she is named King of Mi Ami for the current day and can access to the concert backstage or win a free beer. The other users will see an animation in which their defeat is declared.

###### REFERENCES TO THE LEGEND
The project takes inspiration from the well-known story of the sword in the stone, which tells how a young squire became king after extracting the legendary Excalibur sword from a stone altar.
In the original novel, the main character makes three attempts to extract the sword: this detail inspired us to make the game less based on luck and more based on the cunning of the individual player, who uses the movements made by others to achieve victory.
The choice of a widely known story was determined by the need to have a game dynamic and a setting immediately recognizable by the majority of the population.

## Context
###### MI AMI FESTIVAL
[MI AMI Festival](https://www.miamifestival.it/2020/) "Musica Importante A Milano" is a music festival organized by Rockit.it since 2005. It takes place every year in a park, currently the Idroscalo of Milan, during the last weekend of May. It hosts Italian artists from a predominantly independent area, alternative, without distinction of musical genre but with a careful musical-cultural selection. MI AMI is the most known summer festival of Milano, and it has an indie vibe and style that aligns perfectly with the mood of our site.

</p>

At the beginning the project was designed to be placed at PolEATecnico Bistò (ex Bar La Rossa), creating a more local and restricted experience, but something was missing: it's a community game but the common game atmosphere was not really present. The decision was to move to a larger and more populated environment where you can have a large screen for projecting the live progress of the game, but without forgetting about the sectorization: this site brings together people who are already interested in participating in the same concert experience.

###### THE BIG SCREEN
Thanks to this change of location we can take advantage of the big screen projection of the live game, that will be played in moments of stalemate, like from the opening of the gates and the waiting for the singers, allowing everyone to perceive the position of the sword. It became a real group experience, in which the competition is even more present, given that it will appear both the number of the "knights" that are trying to conquer the sword.

###### REAL WINNING
We thought about a collaboration with Mi Ami Festival, thanks to which there will be a prize offered, such as a backstage meeting with the artist, or free beers for the real king of the day.
<br>


## Design Challenges
Our desire was to make an experience that killed the typical boredom in a queue at the Mi Ami Festival
but also that would be inclusive for everybody, and in order to achieved that we thought about projecting the challenge in the big screen that the Festival stage already has.

###### STRATEGIC GAMEPLAY
We tried to make the game increasingly less a lottery, and much more a meritocratic system of strategy, where everyone can try to understand when is the best time to try and swipe the sword and ensure the victory.
Hence three very important choices:
1. Insert a precision bar within the game screen. This will create a threshold of difficulty, which will allow only the most precise and valiant to raise the sword.
2. Show the number of players in the big screen.
3. Show a timer in the mobile game screen that allows the gamer to understand how long he has to wait before tapping again.

###### ARCADE STYLE GRAPHICS
Everything aims to the facility of the gameplay, that has to be intuitive and really easy to follow, in order to make a lot of people play together without impediments. This includes the stylistic choice of an arcade game, very easy to follow and with graphics that allows you to play it even in a distracted way.

<p align="center">

</p>

###### VISUAL DESIGN
We choose a Pixel Art style, that is almost entirely based on a 51 width pixels grid.
The palette tries to evoke a magic ambience, set into the woods, where the magic sword is stuck. The principal colour is green code #8AECA1, that is then declined in shades of the same green, along with some brown shades. Everything recalls the natural world that Mi Ami Festival tries introduce in the city of Milan.
As for the info and the structure of the game, we used an off-white colour.

## Website experience
The intent is to create an app accessible to all, fast to use even in times of high turnout. To achieve this speed of play, we decided to divide the app into a few short introduction screens, to leave space and time for the action.

###### STEP #1
After the loading screen, it will appear two following screens of brief introduction to the realm and to the rules and guidance in order to play the game.

    <img src="images-readme/iphone-mockup-instructions_2.png" width="400">
</p>

###### STEP #2
Two possibilities:<br>
- if the player is not in the area of "Mi Ami Festival Reign" it will appear a map indicating the distance from the area;<br>
- if the player is in the area on the contrary the game screen will appear, and you can start to play. Here two situations can happen: one where the sword has already been drawn, which will mean that you can try to play again the next day, and one where the sword is still stuck in the rock. You can play in the latter case by swiping the sword.

    <img src="images-readme/iphone-mockup-the_sword_in_the_stone.png" width="400">
</p>

###### STEP #3
The game begins. In between each swipe you will have to wait some seconds, and there will be a timer to indicate this. Also, you will be able to see the other pulling the sword (little craving, huh?). Be careful because if the sword is not touched for some other seconds it will go down completely.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images-readme/iphone-mockup-the_sword_in_the_stone-timer.png" width="400">
</p>

###### STEP #4
If you lose there will be a very sad animation, where everything goes dark and the leaves will star to fall, like recreating a sad autumn atmosphere. After the animation you will just see the empty rock, but don't lose your hopes: you can always try to win the day after!

</p>

###### STEP #4
If you win it will appear a glorious animation, with a cheerful song. After this, you will be able to take a picture with the crown that you had well deserved, and then also save that victorious picture. There will then be a screen with the actual prize that will be agreed with the sponsor.

## Code Challenges

###### BACK-END CODE
We used the server to handle two kinds of data: the number of times the sword has been pulled and the name of the current king. In the first case, a global variable stored and updated by the server for each new successful swipe
could serve us well, since Heroku's service keeps the server active for 24 hours: exactly the time span we needed for our game, because it would be restarted daily. But the name of the winner of the day should be saved in memory also for the next day, and for this reason we needed a different solution to store that data: we found the way to use a Google Sheets document as a small, free to use database, using the Google APIs package for Node.
<br>
To make the experience consistent and continuously shared between the different users, we made the server handle every successful swipe, in order to update the position of the sword for every user at the same time and declare an unique winner when an user makes the decisive swipe. To achieve this last point we used the "broadcast" function from the socket.io package. 
<br>
<b>server side:</b>
```javascript
var updatedPulls = 0;
function newConnection(socket) {
 socket.on("swordPull", function() {

   //CHECKS IF THIS IS THE DECISIVE SWIPE
   if (updatedPulls === maxPullsCount - 1) {

     //MAKES THE SWORD "DISAPPEAR" WHEN THE GAME ENDS
     updatedPulls += 1000;
     //CALLS DIFFERENT EVENTS FOR THE WINNER AND EVERYONE ELSE
     socket.emit("winner");
     socket.broadcast.emit("loser");
   } else {
     updatedPulls += 1;
     swordTimerCount = 30;

     //TRIGGERS AN ANIMATION SHOWING A PULL FROM ANOTHER USER
     socket.broadcast.emit("enemyRay");

     //SENDS THE UPDATED NUMBER OF PULLS TO EACH USER
     io.emit("pullsCountFromServer", updatedPulls);
   }
 })
};
```
<b>client side:</b>
```javascript
function swiped() {
  if (personalCountDown == 0) {

    //CHECKS IF THE SWIPE WAS SUCCESSFUL
    if (barCursor.x >= swipeBar.x - swipeBar.width / 10 && barCursor.x <= swipeBar.x + swipeBar.width / 10) {

      //CALLS THE EVENT swordPull IN THE SERVER TO HANDLE THE SUCCESSFUL SWIPE
      socket.emit("swordPull");
    }
  }

  //RESTARTS THE PERSONAL TIMER AFTER EACH ATTEMPT
  personalCountDown = 300;
}

//LISTENS FOR UPDATES ON THE NUMBER OF PULLS FROM THE SERVER
socket.on("pullsCountFromServer", function(data) {

  //UPDATES THE VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE POSITION OF THE SWORD
  pullsCount = data;
});
```
To update and get the name of the king from our Google Sheets database, we had to set up and use the Google APIs package.
<br>
<b>server side:</b>
```javascript

//SETTING UP THE GOOGLE API AND PROVIDING CREDENTIALS TO ACCESS THE DATA
var { google } = require("googleapis");
var credentials = require("./spreadsheet-credentials.json");
var auth = new google.auth.JWT(
  credentials.client_email,
  null,
  credentials.private_key,
  ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets"],
  null
);

//PROVIDING THE INFORMATIONS TO ACCESS THE DATABASE SPREADSHEET
google.options({
  auth
});
var sheets = google.sheets("v4");
var spreadsheetId = "1Q25gnGC5R3uE4qQHON8njArLOeIcu0IvrbT1jTqy5QQ";

//GLOBAL VARIABLES USED TO STORE AND UPDATE THE NAME OF THE KING RECEIVED FROM USERS AND DATABASE
var updater;
var kingName;

//GETS THE CURRENT KING'S NAME FROM THE DATABASE
function getKingName() {
  sheets.spreadsheets.values.get(
    {
      spreadsheetId,
      range: "swordInStoneData!B1"
    },
    (err, result) => {
      kingName = result.data.values[0][0];
      console.log(kingName);
    }
  );
}

//UPDATES THE CURRENT KING'S NAME IN THE DATABASE USING THE VALUES PROVIDED BY THE WINNER USER
function updateKingName(name) {
  updater = { values: [[name]] };
  sheets.spreadsheets.values.update({
    spreadsheetId,
    range: "swordInStoneData!B1",
    valueInputOption: "USER_ENTERED",
    resource: updater
  });
}

function newConnection(socket) {
  //LISTENS FOR A REQUEST OF THE KING'S NAME BY THE CLIENT
  socket.on("requestKingName", function() {
    //SENDS THE KING'S NAME TO THE CLIENT
    socket.emit("kingNameFromServer", kingName);
  });
  //LISTENS FOR THE SUBMITION OF A NEW KING'S NAME FROM THE WINNER'S SOCKET
  socket.on("submitName", function(submittedName) {
    //UPDATES THE NAME BOTH IN THE DATABASE AND THE SERVER
    updateKingName(submittedName);
    kingName = submittedName;
  });
}
```
<b>client side:</b>
```javascript
var king = "";

function setup() {

//MAKES A REQUEST TO THE SERVER FOR THE KING'S NAME IN ORDER TO SHOW IT IN THE USER INTERFACE
socket.emit("requestKingName");
}

//LISTENS FOR THE DATA FROM THE SERVER
socket.on("kingNameFromServer", function(name) {

  //UPDATES THE KING'S NAME ACCORDING TO THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE SERVER
  king = name;
});

function savePhoto() {

  //SENDS THE NAME SUBMITTED IN THE FORM TO THE SERVER IN ORDER TO UPDATE THE DATABASE
  socket.emit("submitName", casellaNome.value());
}
```
###### DESKTOP AND MOBILE
To understand what kind of device, desktop or mobile, is connected to the game we used if conditions. Through the latter we checked the size of the screen, to then show or hide some elements rather than others or redirect the device to the correct page.
<br>
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/) was used as a reference for the screen width of the devices.
<br>
<b>show/hide:</b>
```javascript
if (window.innerWidth < 575) {
    bgImg = loadImage("assets/the-sword-in-the-stone/spada_roccia-background.png");
  } else {
    bgImg = loadImage("assets/the-sword-in-the-stone/spada_roccia-background_desktop.png");
}
```
<b>redirect:</b>
```javascript
if(windowWidth>575){
    window.open("the_sword_in_the_stone.html", "_self");
}
```
###### PIXEL GRID PHOTO
The Pixel Art style led us to superimpose a grid of squares to simplify the image uploaded from the webcam. To each square of the grid is associated the color of the underlying pixel, creating the classic pixel art effect.

```javascript
//WEBCAM VARIABLES
var capture;
var foto;
var pixelGrid = [];
var rec = false;
var pixelColor = 10;
var xStart;
var xFin;
var yStart;
var yFin;

function setup() {

  //SET THE WEBCAM
  capture = createCapture(VIDEO);
  capture.size(320 - 320 / 4, 260 - 260 / 4);
  capture.hide();
  
  //DEFINE THE POINTS OF THE PIXEL GRID
  xStart = windowWidth / 2 - capture.width / 2;
  yStart = windowHeight / 2 - capture.height + capture.height / 2;
  xFin = windowWidth / 2 + capture.width / 2;
  yFin = windowHeight / 2 + capture.height / 2;
}

function draw() {

  //CREATE A PIXEL GRID OVER THE WEBCAM
  var foto = capture.loadPixels();
  imageMode(CORNER);
  image(foto, xStart, yStart, capture.width, capture.height);
  gridCreate(xStart, xFin, yStart, yFin, 6);
  for (var i = 0; i < pixelGrid.length; i++) {
    var p = pixelGrid[i];
    p.display();
  }
} 

//PIXELGRID (ARRAY GETTING THE COLOR OF THE CAPTURE)
function gridCreate(_xStart, _xFin, _yStart, _yFin, _dim) {
  var pos = 0;
  for (var x = _xStart; x < _xFin; x += _dim) {
    for (var y = _yStart + 1; y < _yFin; y += _dim) {
      var color = get(x, y); //get the COLOR in the X an Y position
      var tempPixel = new Pixel(x, y, color, _dim);
      pixelGrid[pos] = tempPixel; //put the PIXEL in the PIXELGRID array
      pos++; //Go to the next element in the array
    }
  }
}

//PIXEL COLOR
function Pixel(_x, _y, _color, _dim) {
  this.x = _x;
  this.y = _y;
  this.color = _color;
  this.dim = _dim;

  this.display = function() {
    noStroke();
    fill(this.color);
    square(this.x, this.y, this.dim);
  };
}
```

###### TEXT BLINK ANIMATION
<p align="center">
    <img src="images-readme/iphone-loading_screen-video_mockup.gif" width="400">
</p>

To overcome the limitations of p5.js in using text animations, we used the css formatting language to create animations that emulate the classic "PRESS START" command found in many arcade games.

```css
@keyframes blinker {
  0% {
    opacity: 1.0;
  }

  50% {
    opacity: 0.0;
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1.0;
  }
}
```
